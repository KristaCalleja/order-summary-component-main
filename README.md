## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for interactive elements


## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I used this project to recap over some foundational aspects of CSS since I had come across some hurdles in the past weeks. 

### Useful resources

- [Buttons & Links: The Basics](https://ux.iu.edu/writings/buttons-vs-links-basic/) - I keep getting confused when I am to use a <button> or an anchor tag <a>. This article helped me figure out the differences.
